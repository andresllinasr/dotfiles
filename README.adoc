= gitconfig

📝 Some common git configs templates that I personally use.

== Global config

The `.gitconfig` file is intended to be (at least part of) a user's
 global `~/.gitconfig`.

== Contributing

You want to make this even more awesome? That's great! You can open a
 PR on Github (or any other repo hosting site that you may find this
 hosted), or email changes to me. Consider including a relevant
 gitmoji in the commit message!

If you fork and make your own custom changes, don't want bother
 proposing those changes back to the original repo. Just consider
 sending me a link anyway so that I can see what cool things you're
 doing. 😉
