📝 Some common git configs that I personally use.

== Global config

The `.gitconfig` file is intended to be (at least part of) a user's
 global `~/.gitconfig`.

== Contributing

You want to make this even more awesome? That's great! You can open a
 PR on Github (or any other repo hosting site that you may find this
 hosted)

If you fork and make your own custom changes, don't bother yourself
 proposing those changes back to the original repo. Consider
 sending me a link anyway so that I can see what cool things you're
 doing. 😉
