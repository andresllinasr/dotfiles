üìù This repository is created to centralize and keep my config files updated across different computers and operating systems. The configurations shared here are highly personalized. However, I believe the structure and approach I've established can be helpful for keeping your own config files centralized, updated, and organized.

== Global Config

The `.gitconfig` file is meant to be part of a user's global `~/.gitconfig`.

== Installation

To make things easier, I recommend setting VS Code as your default editor first. Set the core editor using this command: `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`. If it doesn't work, you may need to enable the VS Code command first. (See the macOS docs: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#:~:text=Launch%20VS%20Code.,code'%20command%20in%20PATH%20command.)

1. Open the Git config file:
   ```
   git config --global --edit
   ```

2. Copy and paste the contents of `.gitconfig` or use the setup script.

The global Git config file is stored in the user's home directory. The location varies depending on your operating system:
- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>`
- Linux: `~home/<username>`
- Sudo operations: `~root/`

== How to Install on Windows using `script.bat`

The script does the work for you! It automatically updates and copies configuration files, ensuring you're always rocking the latest version. Tested on Windows 11. üòé

1. Clone or download the `.zip` of the main branch from this repository.
2. Simply click on the `script.bat` file to run it. The script takes care of the following steps:
   - Checks if Git is installed and accessible.
   - Runs `git pull` to ensure the latest version.
   - Copies the global config files to the home directory.

Once the script has finished executing, your config should be installed and configured.

== Enabling the VS Code Command

For macOS users:
1. Launch VS Code.
2. Open the Command Palette (‚áß‚åòP) and type 'shell command' to find the "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" command.
